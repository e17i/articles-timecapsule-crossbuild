<h2 id="orgcf6157c">Overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcf6157c">
<p>
As mentioned in a previous post, I'm using my time capsule (also) as a
backup system for my NetBSD/macppc server. For this, I'm usually
mounting the remote file system via <code>mount_afp</code>, then using the <code>dump</code>
and <code>restore</code> tools to dump backups onto it. This works so far, but
when booting into the ram disk of an installation kernel, the
<code>mount_afp</code> command (provided by pkgsrc) is missing. So I was thinking
of cross-compiling the tools needed on the time capsule to provide an
easy access from a NetBSD rescue system. The <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/restore.8"><code>restore(8)</code></a> tool has the
builtin ability to access remote hosts using <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/rcmd.3"><code>rcmd(3)</code></a> and <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/rmt.8"><code>rmt(8)</code></a>.
For this, <code>ssh</code> can be used as remote command execution facility; <code>rmt</code>
is used for an efficient random access to the backup dumps.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8496a2a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8496a2a">Activating ssh on the time capsule</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8496a2a">
<p>
First of all, we want to be able to ssh into the time capsule. The
<code>sshd</code> is already in place, as the time capsule actually is a stripped
down NetBSD system. The ssh access is disabled by default, but can be
reactivated using acp (airport control protocol?).
</p>

<p>
Install airpyrt-tools by Vince Cali:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">git clone https://github.com/x56/airpyrt-tools.git
python airpyrt-tools/setup.py install --user
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then set the dbug property and reboot the time capsule:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">python -m acp -t {hostname} -p {password} --setprop dbug 0x3000
python -m acp -t 1 {hostname} -p {password} --reboot
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, we can ssh into it as root, using the admin password.
Afterwards, you may put your public key into
<code>/root/.ssh/autorized_keys</code>, this way allowing automatic backups to access the
system. But you should probably not deactivate password
authentication. If you need to restore your backup'd system, you
probably won't get in to the backup unless the key is restored&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga13c3ac" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga13c3ac">Building <code>rmt</code> for the time capsule</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga13c3ac">
<p>
Next, as it shows, the <code>rmt</code> tool, used for remote media access by <code>dump</code> and <code>restore</code>,
is missing on the time capsule's reduced NetBSD installation. So, one might
ask, where do I get this from? And the answer is of course, build it yourself.
Using the mostly automated cross building system of NetBSD, this is quite an
easy task. On my time capsule, the system identifies as NetBSD 6.0 evbarm. The
binaries found on the system are built as ELF 32-bit LSB executables, ARM,
EABI4, statically linked. So I started building a cross compilation environment
on my NetBSD 9.0 box, hoping a statically linked binary built in this
environment would still work on the older time capsule. While this took quite a
little bit of time on my trusty PPC machine, it worked straight out of the box
and was probably more easy than to setup a virtualized build service on x86.
</p>

<p>
These commands did it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"><span style="color: #483d8b;">cd</span> /usr/src
./build.sh -U -O ~/arm-build -m evbarm -a earmv4 tools
./build.sh -U -u -O ~/arm-build -m evbarm -a earmv4 distribution
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now the <code>rmt</code> tool can be built as a statically linked program:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"><span style="color: #483d8b;">export</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">LDSTATIC</span>=-static
<span style="color: #483d8b;">cd</span> /usr/src/usr.sbin/rmt
~/arm-build/tooldir.NetBSD-9.0-macppc/bin/nbmake-evbarm
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, we transfer the binary over to the time capsule, put it into <code>/usr/sbin</code> and create a symlink
to <code>/etc/rmt</code>, where <code>dump</code> and <code>restore</code> expect to find it.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"><span style="color: #483d8b;">cd</span> ~/arm-build/usr.sbin/rmt/
scp rmt time-capsule:/usr/sbin/rmt
ssh time-capsule
<span style="color: #483d8b;">cd</span> /usr/sbin; chmod 555 rmt; ln -s /usr/sbin/rmt /etc/rmt
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd9a47b8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd9a47b8">Backup/Restore</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd9a47b8">
<p>
Now, we can directly address the remote disks mounted on the time
capsule via the NetBSD onboard backup tools <code>dump</code> and <code>restore</code>.
To do this, we configure <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/rcmd.3"><code>rcmd(3)</code></a> to use <code>ssh</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"><span style="color: #483d8b;">export</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">RCMD_CMD</span>=ssh
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then we use <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/dump.8"><code>dump(8)</code></a> or <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/restore.8"><code>restore(8)</code></a> with option <code>-f</code> and give a filename in
the form of {hostname}:{path}, where {hostname} is our time capsule
and {path} addresses the backup directory over there. Here it is something
like <code>/Volumes/dk2/ShareRoot/nbsd-backup</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once again, this can also be achieved by piping the data via <code>ssh</code> to
<code>dd</code>, which works flawlessly in most cases. But if you need random
access to different parts of the backup, e.g. when doing an
interactive restore, it doesn't work so well, especially with very
large backup files.
</p>

<p>
For example, to interactively browse such a backup, now you can just use
something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">env <span style="color: #a0522d;">RCMD_CMD</span>=ssh restore -if time-capsule:/Volumes/dk2/ShareRoot/nbsd-backup/dump.2
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org968332e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org968332e">Mounting and accessing the backup devices on the time capsule</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org968332e">
<p>
Stays the question how to mount or access the disks on the time
capsule if they are spun down. At the moment, I've no idea howo to get
this done. So for now I will stay at my approach using afp to remotely access
the time capsule for automatic nightly backups, as described in
<a href="../articles-netbsd-backup">Backup and Restore on NetBSD</a>. To access
the backups via <code>restore/rmt</code>, now I first have to access the drives via
AFP or SMB from another computer in order to get them mounted.
</p>

<p>
But at least I can rest assured I will reach the backup via <code>restore</code>
from an unmodified default NetBSD installation set, if I need to
restore to a new disk.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, if someone has an idea how to spin up and mount the time
capsule disks via command line, I would be grateful if you leave
